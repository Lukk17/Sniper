# ASG Sniper  

Target practice.  



--------------------------------------------
### Importing project  

#### Android Studio/ IDEA Intellij:  
Import whole project (ASG_sniper) and in File > Project Structure... delete all modules.  
Then import whole `ASG_sniper` without any gradle and only "Flutter" module.  
Without any Android modules (it will ask for Android modules twice).  
Mark `lib` as source file and `test` as test.  

#### Visual Studio Code:  
Add whole project folder (ASG_sniper) to workspace.  
Then in platform.io import NodeMCU part - it will be visible as extra folder next to `ASG_sniper`.  
So it will be double - one inside `ASG_sniper` folder and another in workspace root folder.  
This way you can see `.gitignore` and other project files as well as build Flutter app.
